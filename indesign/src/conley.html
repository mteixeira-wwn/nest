			<p class="TX1">In social science, there is a statistical technique called “individual fixed effects.” Basically it boils down to comparing an outcome across time as some factor changes. So, for example, if we want to know whether having kids makes people happier and more fulfilled, we might ask them before they have their first child and then again afterward. Fixed effects can be used to look at the effect of marriage and divorce on health; of education on wages; of home ownership on savings rates; and of family income on kids’ test scores. However, certain key sociological variables resist fixed effects, simply because they don’t change over time. Think race. Think birth cohort. Think parents’ age. And, of course, think sex. Very few people get to experience life in both locker rooms, so to speak. Sex isn’t a boundary we typically flip back and forth across. However, it has been known to happen. Among the estimated more than 25,000 Americans who have undergone sexual reassignment surgery, few are probably better positioned to report with a scientific eye than Deirdre McCloskey, a &#173;Harvard-&#173;trained, &#173;world-&#173;renowned economist who used to be named Donald.</p>
			<p class="TX">Perhaps it was the combination of her gifts of economic science and beautiful writing style that made McCloskey destined to prominently (and touchingly) describe effects of gender (and her associated border crossing) to a wide readership in her memoir, <span class="italic">Crossing </span><span class="italic">(1999)</span>.</p>
			<p class="TX">“It’s strange to have been a man and now to be a woman,” she admits. “But it’s no stranger perhaps than having been a West African and now being an American, or once a priest and now a businessman. Free people keep deciding to make strange crossings, from storekeeper to monk or from civilian to soldier or from man to woman. Crossing boundaries is a minority interest, but human” (McCloskey, 1999, p. xii).</p>
			<p class="TX">Written in the third &#173;person—&#173;certainly rare if not totally unique among &#173;memoirs—&#173;in order to reconcile the multiple selves that McCloskey experienced over the course of her adulthood, <span class="italic">Crossing</span> details the harrowing journey across the invisible yet robust boundary of sex/gender. This voyage was made all the more improbable by McCloskey’s advanced age (52) at the time &#173;then-&#173;Donald initiated the biological process of the change after decades of &#173;cross-&#173;dressing, fathering, and providing for two children, and serving as a husband and professionally active man.</p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">(I use the name Donald here only because McCloskey herself does in her memoir, not because I am “deadnaming” her—i.e. purposely or unconsciously deploying a transgendered person’s birth name as if that were the “true” name.) And the voyage and subsequent reflection was made even more dramatic by the fact that McCloskey’s sister—a professional psychologist—stopped her various surgeries several times by threatening to sue the surgeons and had her committed to a mental hospital against her will. Ultimately, however, Deirdre triumphed: After almost $100,000 of uncovered medical expenses, procedures that were performed across North America and even Australia (including facial bone surgery, voice surgery, and hormone therapy, just to name a few), Deirdre emerged happy, if weatherworn, to document the process of beginning a new life. Estranged from her ex-wife and kids, she nonetheless was relieved to begin the painful process of stretching her neovagina—fashioned from some of her small intestine—for 30 minutes each day; to continue the laborious (and also painful) electrolysis treatments; and to otherwise continue the journey into womanhood—a continent she had previously visited as a cross-dressing tourist, hoping to pass for a native in Donald’s dresses.</span></p>
			<p class="TX">Along the way, McCloskey indeed chronicles a number of changes that she experienced before and after, as man and then as woman. It’s too bad that his &#173;ex-&#173;wife couldn’t stay married to the female McCloskey, because Deirdre speculates that she might, in fact, like this version better: “His wife would become angry if he talked of his Chicago doubt [back when he was deciding whether to leave his faculty position at the prestigious University of Chicago economics department], for it was tedious after a while to listen to the whining. My &#173;ex-&#173;wife would like Deirdre better if she knew her, she reflected. No angst” (p.&#160;149).</p>
			<p class="TX">McCloskey also wrote down 41 differences between Donald and Deirdre, some of which fall into the realm of &#173;well-&#173;worn gender stereotypes. &#173;(McCloskey is not the first to note that however rigid and defended the boundary of sex is, the experience of gender operates along a continuum and consists of a culturally instantiated grab bag of characteristics that are found among individuals of both sexes in varying degrees.) Below are twenty of those differences:</p>
			<p class="BL_First">•&#9;She cries.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She sweats less.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She loses weight less easily.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;Her color memory and color vocabulary are a little better.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She works at remembering what people wear.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She likes cooking.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She listens intently to stories people tell of their lives, and craves detail.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She is more alert to relational details in stories (“Ah, I see, she’s his cousin&#160;by marriage”). </p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She finds herself remembering the family trees, the&#160;&#173;ex-&#173;boyfriends, the big events.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She is less impatient.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She drives more slowly and less aggressively.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She can’t remain angry for long.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She feels duty bound to wash the dishes.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She loves, just loves, the little favors of &#173;womankind—&#173;getting a card for someone, making meatloaf for Charles up the street, helping someone through a day of his life.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She assumes a less confident mask for dealings with salespeople and auto mechanics.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She is uninterested in sports and finds the sports pages pointless.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She no longer thinks of social life as strict exchange.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She dotes on every child she meets.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She has more friends.</p>
			<p class="BL">•&#9;She thinks less about sex.</p>
			<p class="BL_Last">•&#9;She gets as much pleasure from loving as from being loved.</p>
			<p class="TX1">All we need now is a whole group of social scientists to go through this form of participant observation so that we can obtain a statistical distribution of effects! Or maybe not. Actually, sometimes what is gained in narrative is lost in numbers.</p>

			<p class="TX1_Below_H1">If you think Deirdre McCloskey’s list of differences between herself and her male predecessor is long, that’s just a drop in the bucket when it comes to the divergence of men and women, or so says pop psychologist John Gray. Gray argues that men and women differ so fundamentally in their values, attitudes, thought processes, preferences, and behavior patterns that they might as well be from different planets altogether. (Interplanetary travel might explain the exhaustion McCloskey felt after his journey into a she.) Gray writes that men and women don’t even speak the same language, but have distinct biologically and psychically driven styles of communication, feeling, and action.</p>
			<p class="TX">Gray’s relationship guidebook <span class="italic">Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</span> (1992) was a best seller for a decade. It sold more than 14&#160;million copies and inspired nearly a dozen &#173;spin-&#173;offs, from <span class="italic">Mars and Venus on a Date</span> to a diet and health book with recipes such as the &#173;Mars–&#173;Venus supershake. So widely recognized is the book’s title that now, when the tricky issue of gender relations rises to the fore, as it so often does in America, we often discuss the matter in terms of the innate differences between Martians and Venusians.</p>
			<p class="TX">When you deal with the stress of dating and breakups, you might be tempted to use the &#173;Mars–&#173;Venus framework. It offers the appeal of &#173;easy-&#173;to-&#173;grasp, commonsense generalizations. Men and women are different biological organisms, according to Gray, and their biological differences manifest themselves in the ways men and women behave. By nature, allegedly, men don’t like to express their feelings but instead retreat to their “caves” after a hard day at the office. Women are just more expressive and relational, always communicating about their feelings. These things are just biological givens, so individuals must take personal action to navigate what nature’s given us, or so the &#173;self-&#173;help books would have us believe.</p>
			<p class="TX">If you’re a sociologist, this kind of thinking won’t get you too far in explaining concepts such as sex, sexuality, gender, and the many messy complications, exceptions, and social patterns that beg for explanations beyond the individual, psychical, or biological levels. In the marketplace of ideas, sociological explanations are always at a disadvantage compared with pop psychological explanations of complex social phenomena. People prefer quick, easy answers to the long and often arduous sociological route. After all, they make more intuitive sense at first blush, they’re easier to grasp, and we’re accustomed to them. Unfortunately, they are often wrong. On the sociologist’s path, you’ll have to leave behind your &#173;Mars–&#173;Venus guidebooks (including the shortened, illustrated version) and instead take up the sociological imagination. Sex and gender may, in fact, be the most difficult areas to remember that what seems natural is often anything but. The seemingly rigid and innate differences between the “opposite sexes” can turn out to be fluid.</p>
			<p class="TX">In applying our sociological imaginations to sex and gender, we will come across many feminist strands of thought. <span class="TXTKT">Feminism</span> was at first embraced as a &#173;consciousness-&#173;raising movement to get people to understand that gender is an organizing principle of life; gender matters because it structures relations between people. Further, as gender structures social relations, it does this on unequal ground, so there are real powers and privileges at stake in gender ideology. Neoconservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh would have you believe that feminism “was established to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream” (Media Matters for America, 2005). In fact, the basic idea behind feminism is that women and men should be accorded equal opportunities and &#173;respect—&#173;a position that almost anyone in the contemporary United States would be hard pressed to criticize. Feminists tend to be less interested in erasing the differences between men and women than in uncovering the power stakes behind the socially constructed differences between the genders.</p>

			<p class="TX">The sociologist’s first task is to disentangle the terms <span class="italic">sex, sexuality,</span> and <span class="italic">gender.</span> <span class="TXTKT">Sex</span> is typically used to describe the biological differences that distinguish males from females. <span class="TXTKT">Sexuality</span> refers to desire, sexual preference, and sexual identity and behavior. Far from being strictly natural, how we have sex and with whom vary by time and place. <span class="TXTKT">Gender</span> denotes a social position, the set of social arrangements that are built around normative sex categories. It is, you could say, what people do with the physical materials of sex.</p>

			<p class="TX">No one disputes that biological differences exist between men and women. However, what we make of those differences does not inevitably arise out of the biological. Gender is one set of stories we tell each other and believe in to get by in the world. It’s a collectively defined guidebook that humans use to make distinctions among themselves, to separate one being from another, and to comprehend an otherwise fuzzy mass of individuals. But the gender story can change, and we’ll see how it has done so throughout history and across cultures. To grasp this insight takes sociological imagination, and it brings us closer to understanding the power of ideas. We consistently behave as though women act a certain way that is distinct from the behavior of men, until those behaviors and attitudes become so ingrained they seem inevitable. Herein lies the paradox: Gender is a social construction, but it is so deeply rooted and seemingly natural that it is a major structure organizing our everyday &#173;lives—&#173;our goals, our desires, even our bodies. And if gender is a human invention, we have to take it as seriously as we would any other institution, as Judith Lorber argues. In <span class="italic">Paradoxes of Gender</span> (1994), Lorber claims that gender is a social institution that “establishes patterns of expectations for individuals, orders the social processes of everyday life, is built into the major social organizations of society, such as the economy, ideology, the family, and politics, and is also an entity in and of itself.” Although gender is a social construction, it matters in the real world, organizing our &#173;day-&#173;to-&#173;day experiences and having profound consequences for the life chances of men and women. Gender is ultimately about power struggles and how they organize daily life, from household economies and wage labor to birth control and babies’ names.</p>

			<p class="TX1_Below_H1">We make sense of much variation between men and women by referring to their biological differences. This can range from the behavioral consequences of hormones (such as premenstrual syndrome), relative physical strength of bodies (“regular” versus “girl” &#173;push-&#173;ups), brain architecture (subsequent rational or irrational action), and chromosomes (XX or XY). But in so doing, we tend to miss a crucial link between nature and nurture. The study of gender boils down to seeing how the two spheres, nature and nurture, overlap, penetrate, and shape each other. The biological world of sex and bodies does not exist outside of a social world, and the social world of human beings is always made up of human bodies. Studying the links between the two allows us to see the social construction of both gender and sex.</p>
			<p class="TX">Bodies are, so we thought, natural, &#173;God-&#173;given, sacred, hardwired. Human babies come equipped with a set of male or female organs, hormones, and &#173;chromosomes—&#173;what we might call “the plumbing”. We determined by our DNA. Usually think of sex as an either/or binary. You’re either male or female. But in fact, there are some exceptions and blurred lines that have led sociologists to view this model of natural sex as more of an ideal than an absolute.</p>
			<p class="TX">Consider the story of David Reimer, otherwise known as “John/Joan.” In 1976, Reimer was an average baby boy who, at eight months of age, suffered a botched circumcision that left him with virtually no penis. Under the guidance of Dr.&#160;John Money at Johns Hopkins University, Reimer’s parents agreed to have their son undergo sex reassignment surgery. David was surgically made into a girl, Brenda, who would go on to endure one heck of a tough childhood.</p>
			<p class="TX">John Money claimed for years that Brenda was a success story of his approach to dealing with intersex children, those who are born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. Here was proof that nurture trumped nature in sexual identity; you could raise a genetic male as a girl and she’d turn out just fine. Sex reassignment surgery was the best solution to cases like David Reimer’s, Money argued. As it turns out, Money was wrong. Despite the hormone treatments and her frilly dresses and curly hair, Brenda never felt comfortable as a girl. When Reimer learned the truth in his adolescence, he made several suicide attempts before eventually changing his sex identity back to that of a male. Later, he underwent reconstructive surgery that enabled him to have a normal sex life (Colapinto, 2000). According to his mother he still “felt he had no options” after his expenences and died by suicide in 2004 at age 38.</p>
			<p class="TX">John/Joan’s story has had little effect on the way physicians treat intersex children. Most notable has been the founding of the Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) in 1993, which advocates reform in the medical practice of sex reassignment (ISNA, 2006). Surgeons today still recommend secretive surgery during infancy to make intersex children conform to an ideal of normal genitalia. About 90&#160;percent of these surgeries reassign an ambiguous male anatomy into a female one because, in the disquieting phrase of the surgical world, “It’s easier to make a hole than build a pole.” A 2000 American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on intersex surgery states that “the birth of a child with ambiguous genitalia constitutes a social emergency.” To quickly resolve the “emergency,” doctors are advised to examine external genitalia “to determine the degree of masculinization.” Furthermore, the statement continues, “The size of the phallus and its potential to develop at puberty into a sexually functional penis are of paramount importance.” So size does matter, it seems, at least to doctors.</p>
			<p class="TX">A general rule among doctors is that a phallus less than 2 centimeters in length constitutes a “micropenis” (although that standard changes from time to time), and a male infant would be better off raised as a female rather than suffer the shame of a small penis. While physicians claim to have the interests of the child and the parents at heart, what else is at stake in intersex births? The social notion of a binary sex is also being protected. A binary sex system imposes order in the world and helps us makes sense of an otherwise complicated mass of populations. Yet it also limits our ability to&#160;accept difference. It is the goal of ISNA to reduce embarrassment and secrecy over intersex conditions.</p>
			<p class="TX">Most people &#173;think—&#173;if they think about it at &#173;all—&#173;that the medical construction of sex applies only to a handful of individuals. Based on a review of medical literature from 1955 to 1998, Brown University biology researcher Anne &#173;Fausto-&#173;Sterling estimates that the number of deviations from the binary of male or female bodies may be as high as 2&#160;percent of live births, and the number of people receiving “corrective” genital surgery runs between 1 and 2 in every 1,000 births (&#173;Fausto-&#173;Sterling, 2000). Just to give you an idea of what 2 in 1,000 looks like, there are now about 2 in 1,000 children born with Trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome), a biological condition that is more visible than intersex. Human variation within and across the two sexes is surprisingly high, and intersex activists point to the fact that social discomfort and fear of difference, rather than medical necessity, may be what pushes parents and surgeons to the operating table.</p>
			<p class="TX">Surgically constructed versions of “proper” sex organs are based on versions of sex organs that are widely agreed upon to be “normal.” in conjunction with one on which most of us also agree. What makes a male a male and not a female? To answer this, many people would unhesitatingly mention the presence of testosterone and a penis. But consider for a moment that women also have some &#173;testosterone—&#173;the chemical boundaries are not as rigid as our socially constructed categories. If you’re having trouble with the modern medical definition of sex categories, then perhaps the ancient Greeks can persuade you to consider the sociohistorical production of sex. Our &#173;present-&#173;day understanding of sex, in fact, goes way back.</p>
			<p class="H2">Sexed Bodies in the Premodern World</p>
			<p class="TX1">Whereas Dr.&#160;John Money operated on a mutually exclusive &#173;two-&#173;sex model of human body types, a lesser known but equally plausible “&#173;one-&#173;sex” model dominated Western biological thought from the ancient Greeks until the &#173;mid-&#173;eighteenth century (Laqueur, 1990). In the old &#173;one-&#173;sex way of thinking, there was only one body (a male body) and the female body was regarded as its &#173;inversion—&#173;that is, as a male body whose parts were flipped inside rather than hanging on the outside. People believed that women were a lesser but not so radically different version of men.</p>
			<p class="TX">Not until the &#173;two-&#173;sex model of human bodies gained ground did women and men become such radically different creatures in the popular conception. Incidentally, historian Thomas Laqueur shows us that this differentiation of bodies prompted changes in ideas about the female orgasm. In the &#173;one-&#173;sex model, it was believed that both a man’s orgasm and a woman’s were requirements for conception. (There is new medical evidence that dual orgasms do increase the chance of conception.) In the &#173;mid-&#173;1800s, female orgasm was considered unnecessary. Whereas &#173;seventeenth-&#173;century (female) midwives advised &#173;would-&#173;be mothers that the trick to conceiving lay in an orgasm, &#173;nineteenth-&#173;century (male) doctors debated whether it was even possible for women to experience orgasm.</p>
			<p class="H2">Contemporary Concepts of Sex and the&#160;Paradoxes&#160;of Gender</p>
			<p class="TX1">The point of all this sex talk is to challenge our tendency to think of bodies as wholly deterministic. This is not to say that biology isn’t a driving force, but merely to acknowledge that our understandings of, categorizations of, and behavior toward bodies are not set in stone. By contrast, essentialist arguments, also called <span class="TXTKT">essentialism</span>, explain social phenomena in terms of natural ones. The hallmarks of essentialism are fixity, lack of history, absolutism, and &#173;<span class="TXTKT">biological &#173;determinism</span>—&#173;meaning that what you do in the social world should be a direct result of who you are in the natural world. If you are born with male parts, essentialists believe, you are essentially and absolutely a man, and you will be sexually attracted to women only, as preordained by nature. Medical experts today maintain the ideal of a dimorphic or binary (either male or female) model of sex by tweaking babies who blur the boundaries. The trick is to recognize that the very boundaries separating male and female bodies are themselves somewhat contested.</p>

			<p class="TX">This is not to say that there is no biological reality or that everything is a social construction. However, a common assumption we make is that biology comes before or dictates behavior, but sociologists now think of the &#173;nature–&#173;behavior relationship as a &#173;two-&#173;way street. Confused yet? Feminist philosopher Elizabeth Grosz (1994) proposes that we view the relationship between the natural and the social (in this case, sex and gender) as existing on a Möbius strip. The Möbius strip is an old math puzzle that looks like a twisted ribbon loop, yet it has just one side and one edge. Biological sex, the plumbing, makes up the inside of the strip, whereas the social &#173;world—&#173;culture, experience, and &#173;gender—&#173;make up the outside. But as happens in the contours of gender, the inside and outside surfaces are inseparable. In thinking or talking about sex and gender, we often switch from one to the other without even noticing that we’ve changed our focus (&#173;Fausto-&#173;Sterling, 2000). Some societies in various historical periods have made sense of the plumbing in different ways, and these explanations become the social construction of gender.</p>

			<p class="TX1_Below_H1">You have now learned about a case in which sex was conferred rather than innate. Medically and historically, biological sex does not exist in the world in some fixed, natural state. Our next step is to trace the different social senses that humans have taken from sex. There are many historical and &#173;cross-&#173;cultural meanings, roles, and scripts for behavior that we like to think correspond to more or less fixed biological categories. This complete set of scripts is what sociologists refer to as gender, or the division of people, behaviors, and institutions into two categories: male and female.</p>
			<p class="TX">Much like sex difference, people tend to think that gender difference is a natural cleavage between two static &#173;groups—&#173;you’re either a man or a woman. Why do men tend to fight one another, dominate the hard sciences, and outnumber women in the top political offices? Why do women tend to mother, stay more connected with their families, and outnumber men in occupations that involve caring for others? The short (essentialist) answer is that men and women are naturally (that is, biologically) different, so they behave differently.</p>
			<p class="TX">The longer, sociological answer is that gender differences are much more fluid and ambiguous than we may care to admit. They cannot be  easily explained by appeals to natural differences between the sexes, because gender isn’t natural: It’s a social institution, as Judith Lorber claimed (1994). Gender establishes patterns of expectations for people, orders our daily lives, and is one of the fundamental building blocks of &#173;society—&#173;law, family, education, the economy, everything. The process of forming a gendered identity starts before a person is even born, as soon as the fetus is identified. Through socialization and personality development, a child acquires a gendered identity that, in most cases, reproduces the attitudes, values, and actions that his or her social milieu deems suitable for a boy or girl. (Recall our discussion of gender roles in Chapter&#160;4.) We impose rigid boundaries to maintain a gender order, but if we look at how gender systems vary, we can expose those boundaries as social constructions. If gender is a set of stories we tell ourselves to get through the complications of living, those stories are subject to change, but they do have real consequences for us, the actors who star in that story.</p>
			<p class="H2">Gender Differences in Other Cultures</p>
			<p class="TX1">One crucial part of the story we hear about gender is that only two genders exist, just like our idea about sex. John Gray would surely have been writing a very different book if the title had been <span class="italic">Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, and Everyone in Between Is from Earth.</span> Many Western cultures struggle to divide the world neatly between men and women with correspondingly clear male and female bodies. Not so, however, for the Navajo society of Native Americans. In Navajo tribes, there are not two but three genders: masculine men, feminine women, and the <span class="italic">nadle.</span> The <span class="italic">nadle</span> might be born with ambiguous genitalia at birth or they may declare a <span class="italic">nadle</span> identity later on regardless of genitalia. The <span class="italic">nadle</span> perform both masculine and feminine tasks and dress for the moment, according to whatever activity they’re doing. Although they are often treated like women, they have the freedom to marry people of any gender, “with no loss of status” (Kimmel, 2000).</p>
			<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Nadles</span> are not the only non western examples of non binary gender configurations. Serena Nanda (1990) and Gayatri Reddy (2005) studied <span class="italic">hijras</span> in India, a group that is often included in textbooks like this one to stand in as proof that a binary either/or gender system is not so natural after all. From Reddy we know that “hijras are phenotypic men who wear female clothing and ideally, renounce sexual desire and practice by undergoing a sacrificial &#173;emasculation—&#173;that is, an excision of the penis and testicles” (Reddy, 2005). To our Western ears, then, these men who renounce manhood but who are not women are actively staking a claim for a third gender. But Reddy goes on to develop the definition of what it means to be a <span class="italic">hijra,</span> which includes behaviors that may have little to do with gender: dedication to the goddess Bedhraj Mata, conferring fertility to newlyweds and newborns; a sometimes reluctant, sometimes quite dedicated entry into prostitution; communal living; &#173;self-&#173;sacrifice; and poverty. Thus <span class="italic">hijra</span> identity is a master status, but it is not experienced by the <span class="italic">hijras</span> as a fight for turf between gender categories. Like Don Kulick’s Brazilian <span class="italic">travesti</span> (see page 000), the <span class="italic">hijras</span> may have few qualms about the balance they’ve struck between gender and sexuality and more fears about the way their poverty will shape their chances in life. To be sure, the widespread &#173;stigmatization—&#173;both groups are believed to be violent and &#173;untrustworthy—&#173;is likely related to their transgression of the traditonal boundaries shaping and containing gender and sexuality practices, but using these two groups as measuring sticks against which the Western sex and gender binaries can be dismantled is a &#173;short-&#173;sighted exercise of the sociological imagination.</p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">More relevant is the growing prominence and social awareness of transgender Americans who come from all social classes, work in a very wide range of jobs, and are not living separately from others in society. Amos Mac, a man who was raised as a girl, came to talk to my class about his experience and the magazine </span><span class="italic" lang="en-GB">Original Plumbing</span><span lang="en-GB"> he publishes for a transgender audience. When I asked Mac whether he felt more like a man now than he had before he transitioned, he politely corrected me for my assumptions about a before/after binary gender narrative, “I actually don’t even know like what is a man supposed to feel like. You know, I don’t really know what a woman is supposed to feel like.</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">.</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">.</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">. I feel comfortable in my skin right now, and I feel comfortable the way people are perceiving me, like strangers on the street. I don’t care people know my history.”</span><span class="bold" lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">He allows that some of his friends may have been “born knowing something [was] terribly wrong</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">.</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">.</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">. or that they [didn’t] feel comfortable in their body,” but that there is no common narrative that encompasses what being transgender is like. Mac explained, “I don’t think there’s a right or wrong way to have this experience, and I don’t think it’s necessarily a fun one that you would want to go out of your way to have.” The search or space for a third gender may be limited by our assumption that gender should be a fixed category at all. Maybe gender is a spectrum that is constantly changing, along which individuals may change positions over their lifetimes.</span></p>
			<p class="H2">Gender Differences across History</p>
			<p class="TX1">Within a &#173;two-&#173;gender system, there is enormous variation in what counts as a “good” or “bad” man or woman. For example, how the ideal man or woman looks is itself historically contingent. Specifically, ideal feminine beauty has been a continuous site of change and contestation. Look at the &#173;seventeenth-&#173;century Rubenesque women, the voluptuous beauties who by today’s high-fashion standards are simply fat. In traditional economies where food was scarce, a plump woman was a sign of good health, wealth, and attractiveness. The &#173;long-&#173;standing preference for a robust female body has changed as industrialized societies moved from relative scarcity of food to plenitude. Today the cheaper foods are the fattening ones, and gym membership is only for those with enough disposable income. Contrary to the slogans, bigger isn’t better in this &#173;economy—&#173;not if you’re a woman, at least.</p>
			<p class="TX">Accompanying this economic expansion, the transition to modern Western society also brought advances in medical knowledge and scientific discourse. By the 1920s, the female figure was standardized by the development of norms for healthy weights according to height. The fleshy Rubens women no longer fit a beauty ideal; they don’t even look healthy.</p>
			<p class="H2">Gender Differences Today</p>
			<p class="TX1">Today’s idealized (white, &#173;middle-&#173;class) standards for feminine beauty in the United States present a dilemma for millions of women and girls. Approximately 3&#160;percent of the&#160;U.S.&#160;population meets the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, and 90&#160;percent of those digonosed are is female (Swanson et&#160;al., 2011). In 2014, women had approximately 9.6&#160;million cosmetic procedures. The top five cosmetic surgical procedures for women were liposuction (also the most popular procedure for men), breast augmentation, eyelid surgery, tummy tucks, and breast reduction. Americans spent almost $12.4&#160;billion on cosmetic procedures in 2014, yet their quest for ideal beauty is likely the pursuit of an illusion.</p>
			<p class="TX">Dominant or “emphasized” definitions of &#173;femininity—&#173;as embodied by &#173;looks—&#173;are always undergoing change, from the hysterical Victorian housewife to the sporty working girl of the 1980s to today’s heroically perfect-in-all-ways supermom. This might be an easy point to grasp about femininity, but most people think that masculinity is less subject to such trends and fashions. It is always harder to denaturalize the dominant category; being the norm, it often is invisible. Among social categories, those who go unquestioned tend to be most privileged.</p>
			<p class="TX">In addition to a dominant image of femininity, some theorists argue that today there exists a <span class="TXTKT">hegemonic masculinity</span> as well (Connell, 1987). Hegemony is the complete dominance of a group of people, a type of power so complete that it goes unnoticed by the people who are dominated. Hegemonic masculinity is so dominant that it easily escapes our attention and is regarded as the norm against which all others are judged. Erving Goffman (1963) describes this masculine ideal as a young man who is “married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual, Protestant, father, of college education, fully employed, of good complexion, weight and height, and [with] a decent record in sports.”</p>
			<p class="TX">Today’s ideal man has not always been the hegemonic definition. In <span class="italic">Manhood in America</span> (1996), Michael Kimmel traces the development of masculinity in the West and finds that in the eighteenth century, the ideal man was not associated with physical fitness, &#173;money-&#173;making endeavors, or sports. Business endeavors were the boorish concerns of the rude trade classes, and physical strength undermined one’s gentlemanly dispositions. Ideal masculinity in the 1700s went hand in hand with kindness and intellect, and preferably a little poetry, a very different image from the &#173;modern-&#173;day ideal of the “man’s man.”</p>
			<p class="TX">Over time and from place to place, gender roles are fluid, changing, and &#173;context-&#173;specific. Chapter&#160;4 on socialization stated that <span class="TXTKT">gender roles</span> are sets of behavioral norms assumed to accompany one’s status as a male or female. Many of the differences we observe between men and women do not have much to do with gender differences at all; instead, the behaviors arise as a result of the different positions men and women occupy. Sociologist Cynthia Fuchs Epstein calls these “deceptive distinctions,” that grossly exaggerate the actual differences between men and women (1988). What makes a man a man and not a woman? The sociological answer begins with “It depends.”</p>
			<p class="TX">Many sociologists think of gender as a major building block in the social order and as an integral element in everyday life. It is so fundamental to the way our lives go that it is often viewed as an organizing principle of every interaction with others and even with oneself (Stacey &amp; Thorne, 1985). That is, all social institutions and &#173;practices—&#173;education, marriage, law, the economy, fashion, health care, even baby &#173;names—&#173;are in some way tied up with gender norms and expectations. And gender crosses paths with other social statuses, such as race, class, nationality, and even body type, in significant and materially consequential ways. To speak of gender as a social construction is to say that it isn’t a given. Gender is a phenomenon that shapes reality and organizes our lives even if we don’t realize it, and even when we wish it didn’t. Therefore, one goal central to the feminist movement has been to unpack and understand what gender is, how it is constructed, and why it takes the forms it does.</p>

			<p class="TX1">At the start of the second wave of the feminist movement in the 1960s, theorists scrambled to find an answer to the “woman question”: What explains the nearly universal dominance of men over women? What is the root of <span class="TXTKT">patriarchy</span>, a system involving the subordination of femininity to masculinity? Anthropologist Gayle Rubin was one of the first in a long string of thinkers to argue that the nearly universal oppression of women was in need of an explanation. In the field of anthropology, most scholars studying societies around the world had previously assumed that women’s subordination was a given. If such subordination occurred everywhere, it must be fulfilling some function, and it could just as well be passed over in favor of more novel research questions.</p>
			<p class="TX">Rubin challenged this notion and proposed the “sex/gender system” in which, she argued, every society participates in some form or other (1975). In this system, the raw materials of biological sex are transformed through kinship into asymmetrical gender statuses. She used the structural perspective of Claude &#173;Lévi-&#173;Strauss, a French anthropologist, to suggest that because of the universal taboo against &#173;incest—&#173;fathers and brothers cannot sleep with their daughters and &#173;sisters—&#173;women who start out belonging to one man (their father, or their brother if dad dies) must leave their families of origin and go belong to another man (their husband). Women are treated like valuable property whose trade patterns strengthen relations between families headed by men. This “traffic in women” gives men certain rights over their female kin. The resulting sex/gender system, she argued, was not a given; it was the result of human interaction.</p>
			<p class="TX">Rubin’s theories made waves. Feminist thinkers widely agreed that the task at hand was to explain universal male dominance. Why were &#173;women—&#173;despite a few token examples of matrifocal or &#173;women-&#173;led tribes in the anthropology &#173;books—&#173;always on the bottom of stratification systems? Why did women in almost every society seem to get short shrift? Anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo (1974) answered that it must be women’s universal association with the private sphere. Because women give birth and then rear children, they become identified with domestic life, which universally is accorded less prestige, value, and rewards than men’s public sphere of work and politics. Another plausible answer to the “woman question” came from fellow anthropologist Sherry Ortner (1974), who claimed that women are furthermore identified with something that every culture defines as lower than &#173;itself—&#173;nature. A woman, she reasoned, comes to be identified with the chaos and danger of nature because of bodily functions like lactation and menstruation (what feminist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir [1952] has poetically described as “woman’s enslavement to the species”).</p>
			<p class="H2">Parsons’s Sex Role Theory</p>
			<p class="TX1">Ortner’s answer to the “woman question” sounds like a plausible one. But note the binary logic at work in these anthropological accounts: culture versus nature, private versus public, man versus woman. However, the world is less rigid, more nuanced, and certainly less easily molded into binary categories than these theories suggest. What underlies these theoretical approaches is <span class="TXTKT">structural functionalism</span>. This theoretical tradition dominated early anthropological thought, and it assumed that every society had certain structures (such as the family, the division of labor, or gender) that existed to fulfill some set of necessary functions. Talcott Parsons, an influential American sociologist of the 1950s, offered a widely accepted functionalist account of gender relations (Parsons, 1951). According to Parsons’s &#173;<span class="TXTKT">sex&#160;</span><span class="TXTKT">role</span><span class="TXTKT">&#160;theory</span>, the nuclear family is the ideal arrangement in modern societies because it fulfills the function of reproducing workers. With a &#173;work-&#173;oriented father in the public sphere and a &#173;domestic-&#173;oriented mother in the private sphere, children are most effectively reared to be future laborers who can meet the labor demands of a capitalist system. Sex, sexuality, and gender are taken to be stable and dichotomous, meaning that each has two categories. Each category is assigned a role and a given script that actors carry out according to the expectations of those roles, which are enforced by social sanctions to ensure that the actors do not forget their lines. Women and men play distinctive roles that are functional for the whole of society; a healthy, harmonious society exists when actors stick to their normal roles. Generally speaking, according to Parsons, social structures such as gender and the division of labor are held in place because they work to ensure a stable society.</p>
			<p class="TX">Functionalism was a hit in the 1950s; it makes intuitive sense and conveniently explains away otherwise difficult social facts fraught with exceptions. But Parsons’s sex role theory falls short on several points. For starters, the argument is &#173;tautological—&#173;that is, it explains the existence of a structure in terms of its function, essentially claiming that things work the way they do because they work. In explaining a phenomenon in terms of its function, functionalists relied on the presumption that the need for the function preexists the phenomenon, a tricky leap of logical faith. Furthermore, they glossed over the possibility that other structures could fulfill the same functions.</p>
			<p class="TX">The functionalist sex role story also does not explain how and why structures change throughout history. If traditional husband and wife sex roles were so functional, why did they change drastically in the 1970s? In Parsons’s account, gender roles appear to be a matter of voluntarism, as if women and men choose, independently of external power constraints, to be housewives and breadwinners. &#173;Finally—&#173;and this is a problem with much early feminist thinking as &#173;well—&#173;sex and gender are regarded as being composed of dichotomous roles, when these categories are, in fact, fuzzy, flexible, and variable in combination with other social positions, such as race and class.</p>
			<p class="H2">Psychoanalytic Theories</p>
			<p class="TX1">Where functionalism focuses too much, perhaps, on society as a whole, Freudian theorists have provided an overly individualistic, psychoanalytic account of sex roles. The father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (&#173;1856–&#173;1939), famously quipped, “Anatomy is destiny.” Although biological determinism plays a major role in Freudian theory, so does the idea that gender develops through family socialization.</p>
			<p class="TX">According to Freud’s developmental psychology, girls and boys develop masculine and feminine personality structures through early interactions with their parents. Boys, so the story goes, have a tormented time achieving masculinity because they must resolve the oedipal complex. In this stage of development, around age 3, every normal boy experiences heterosexual love for his attentive mother. But he realizes quickly that he will be castrated (psychologically, not literally) by his father if he continues to fancy his mother. To resolve the oedipal stage, the boy rejects his mother, in turn emulating his emotionally distant father and developing rigid ego boundaries.</p>
			<p class="TX">Girls do not experience quite the same resolution to their analogous “penis envy.” When a little girl realizes that she lacks the plumbing to have sexual relations with her mother, she experiences penis envy toward her father. However, she ultimately realizes that one day she too can have a baby, thus providing feminine gratification. Girls end up identifying with their mothers, growing up with less rigid ego boundaries and more easily connecting with others than boys do.</p>
			<p class="TX">Feminist psychoanalyst Nancy Chodorow (1978) applied Freud’s theory to answer a particular version of the “woman question”: Why are women predominantly the caregivers? She reasoned that parents’ unequal involvement in child rearing was a partial cause for the universal oppression of women. Her answer was that mothering by women is reproduced in a cycle of role socialization, in which little girls learn to identify as mothers and little boys as fathers. Social structures such as gender roles and the division of labor induce the psychological process of forming a gender identity, and they in turn reproduce themselves when women raise children and men work outside the home. Chodorow argued that egalitarian relations between the sexes would be possible if men shared the mothering.</p>
			<p class="TX">Carol Gilligan (1982) also adapted Freudian psychology to make the case that men and women have different ways of thinking. By her account, women make major life decisions (such as choosing whether or not to have an abortion) based on what she calls an “ethics of care.” Women, she claimed, tend to view the world as composed of human connections and relationships. In contrast, men make decisions by adhering to a system of rules. For them, the world is governed by impersonal, abstract rules and notions of justice.</p>
			<p class="TX">Gilligan found evidence of men’s and women’s “different voices” in the playground observations of sociologist Janet Lever. Little boys, observed Lever, tend to play competitive, &#173;rule-&#173;intensive games (like war), whereas little girls play cooperative and &#173;people-&#173;based games (like house). Lever also found that when a conflict erupted on the playground, boys argued with appeals to the rules of the game. They made and judged claims such as “It’s not fair!” and then were able to continue their game. Girls, however, played shorter and less complex games. When a conflict broke out, they were more likely to bend the rules to spare each other’s feelings, or they would just give up and quit (Lever, 1976).</p>
			<p class="TX">If the “different” theoretical approaches of Chodorow and Gilligan sound reasonable, let’s look at two variations on Freudian explanations for why girls and boys turn out the way they do. Melanie Klein (&#173;1882–&#173;1960) expanded Freud’s account of child development to emphasize the importance of the mother’s role. She claimed that boys suffer breast envy (Klein, 1949). Jacqueline Stevens went further, arguing that boys suffer from pregnancy envy on their way to acquiring a masculine identity that focuses on the acquisition of property and territory, through finance and war, in lieu of the baby they secretly lament not being able to have (Stevens, 2006).</p>
			<p class="TX">Before you see a psychoanalyst to discuss your own penis or pregnancy envy, consider the biological reductionism in all these psychological accounts. For starters, Freud’s theories lacked empirical evidence and were based on the model of a &#173;two-&#173;parent nuclear family. Most of you reading this probably did not grow up in the traditional family setting on which Chodorow and Gilligan based their &#173;research—&#173;a white, &#173;middle-&#173;class, nuclear family with a working father and &#173;stay-&#173;at-&#173;home mother. Sociologist Carol Stack underscored this point in her ethnography of a poor black community. In <span class="italic">All Our Kin</span> (1974), she finds that the division between male and female roles and attitudes is not as &#173;clear-&#173;cut as Freud would have us think. Caregiving is a valued responsibility for both men and women, who are oriented toward a larger network of community and family.</p>
			<p class="TX">Moreover, Chodorow, Gilligan, Klein, and Stevens take for granted a binary sex/gender system, whereas we know that those categories are much more fluid in real life. These psychological theories of gender development contain elements of essentialist thinking as well. Recall that in essentialist arguments, social behavior is reduced to natural, biologically determined behavior. On the extreme end of essentialist thought is Freud, who claimed that “anatomy is destiny.” Although Chodorow and Gilligan move away from such a reductionist stance by locating the root of gender differences in the household division of labor, they both treat men and women as agents who have inherent and necessary personality traits. Gilligan argues that not only are men and women inherently different, but women are so much the better because they’re more relational and connected to others. Feminist historian Joan&#160;W.&#160;Scott (1988) calls this the “herstory” approach in women’s history, in which feminists try so hard to include women’s experiences that they end up assessing everything women do as superb. Such theorists fail to recognize that not all women adopt an ethics of care or relational orientation.</p>
			<p class="H2">Conflict Theories</p>
			<p class="TX1">By the 1980s, another wave of thinkers began to tackle an issue missing from earlier discussions of the “woman question”: power. Conflict theorists mixed &#173;old-&#173;school Marxism with feminism to claim that gender, not class, was the driving force of history. Socialist feminists, also known as radical feminists, claimed that the root of all social relations, including relations of production, stemmed from unequal gender relations.</p>
			<p class="TX">Economist Heidi Hartmann (1981) and legal theorist Catharine &#173;MacKinnon (1983), for example, both analyzed how capitalism combines with patriarchy to make women economically dependent on men’s incomes. This means that in a capitalist society, women have a disadvantaged position in the job market and within the family. Capitalists (that is, men) in turn reap all the benefits of women’s subordination. When women are subordinate, men benefit. To radical feminists, gender inequality is first and foremost about power inequalities, and gender differences (as in personality development) emerge from there. However, what lies beneath these conflict theories is yet another variant of essentialism. Radical feminists basically posited that the world is divided into two groups: men and women (red flag number one). These two groups are necessarily pitted against each other in a struggle for resources (red flag number two). Again, men and women are reduced to automatons in a static battle, which women always lose.</p>
			<p class="H2">“Doing Gender”: Microinteractionist Theories</p>
			<p class="TX1">A social theory is useful only if it helps you understand the social world in which you live. Of course, there are power differentials and forces of socialization that operate in the world. But men and women act and interact in a variety of ways and with unlimited possibilities for outcomes. Gender is also a process, as social constructionists have argued. Candace West and Don&#160;H.&#160;Zimmerman, for example, argue in their influential article “Doing Gender” (1987) that gender is not a fixed identity that we take with us into our interactions. Rather, it is the product of those interactions. In this framework, gender is a matter of active doing, not simply a matter of natural being. To be a man or a woman, they argue, is to perform masculinity or femininity constantly.</p>
			<p class="TX">The “doing gender” perspective is rooted in Erving Goffman’s dramaturgical theory, symbolic interactionism, and ethnomethodology. That is, West and Zimmerman argue that people create their social realities and identities through interactions with one another. Unlike the structural functionalists, psychoanalysts, and conflict theorists, however, social constructionists view gender roles as having &#173;open-&#173;ended scripts. Perhaps individuals come to the stage situated differently according to their place in power hierarchies or personality development, but their lines and gestures are far from being predetermined. Regardless of social location, individuals are always free to act, sometimes in unexpected ways that change the course of the play. But by and large, as a result of “doing gender,” people contribute to, reaffirm, and reproduce masculine dominance and feminine submissiveness.</p>
			<p class="H2">Black Feminism</p>
			<p class="TX1">If gender is a performance, it is much more than a set of neutral scripts that we voluntarily follow. Our actions are influenced by structural forces that we might not even be aware of, such as class or race privilege. As Patricia Hill Collins (1990) claims, we “do” a lot more than gender; gender intersects with race, class, nationality, religion, and so forth. Black feminists have made the case that early liberal feminism was largely by, about, and for white &#173;middle-&#173;class women. In trying to answer the “woman question” and explain women’s oppression, early feminists assumed that all women were in the same oppressed boat. In so doing, they effaced multiple lines of fragmentation and difference into one simple category: woman. For example, by championing women’s rights to work outside the home in <span class="italic">The Feminine Mystique </span>(1963/1997), leading &#173;second-&#173;wave feminist Betty Friedan ignored the experiences of thousands of &#173;working-&#173;class and nonwhite women who were already working, sometimes holding down two jobs to support their families.</p>
			<p class="TX">“Woman” is not a stable or obvious category of identity. Rather, women are differentially located in what Collins calls a “matrix of domination.” A &#173;40-&#173;year-&#173;old poor, black, and straight single mother living in rural Georgia will not have the same conception of what it means to be a woman as a &#173;25-&#173;year-&#173;old professional, white, single lesbian in Chicago. More fundamentally, she argues, black women face unique oppressions that white women don’t. For instance, black women experience motherhood in ways that differ from the white masculinist ideal of the family, as “bloodmothers,” “othermothers,” and “community othermothers,” thus revealing that white masculine notions of the world are sometimes irrelevant to the daily lives of black women (Collins, 1990).</p>
			<p class="TX">Gender, sexual orientation, race, class, nationality, ability, and other factors all intersect. Just as some women enjoy privilege by virtue of their wealth, class, education, and skin color, some men are disadvantaged by their lack of these same assets. As bell hooks (1984) noted, if women’s liberation is aimed at making women the social equals of men, women should first stop and consider which men they would like to equal. Certainly, not all men are privileged over all women. Making universal comparisons of men to women misses these nuances and implicitly excludes marginally positioned people from the discussion.</p>
			<p class="TX">Power comes from many different angles; it doesn’t sit evenly on a plane for all women. When the black activist Sojourner Truth (&#173;1797–&#173;1883) asked, “Ain’t I a woman?” (1851), she summed up some elusive philosophical questions: What is woman? Who counts as a woman and why?</p>
			<p class="H2">Postmodern Theories</p>
			<p class="TX1">As perspectives have expanded and previously rigid categories have begun to crumble, the validity of the “woman question” is itself now in question. For instance, anthropologist Oyèrónké Oyˇewùmí argues that the “woman question” is a product of uniquely Western thought and cannot be applied to African societies. In <span class="italic">The Invention of Women</span> (1997), she presents ethnographic research of Yoruban society in West Africa, which she claims was once a genderless society. In Yoruba, before the arrival of anthropologists, villagers did not group themselves as men or women or use body markers at all. Rather, they ranked themselves into strata by seniority. When Western feminist scholars arrived on the scene, presuming the preexistence of gender relations, they, of course, found a system of gender. But this system of &#173;categories—&#173;distinct males and &#173;females—&#173;indicates a Western cultural logic, what Oyˇewùmí has termed “&#173;bio-&#173;logic.”</p>
			<p class="TX">&#173;Bio-&#173;logic runs deep in our cultural experiences and understandings of gender. It acts as a sort of filter through which all knowledge of the world runs, though there may be different ways of knowing outside such a paradigm. But if “woman” is such an unstable &#173;category—&#173;one that is merely “performed,” as postmodern theorist Judith Butler says, one that is so fragmented and trapped in &#173;discourse—&#173;how are we supposed to study it? Feminists must have some sturdy ground on which to unite, build coalitions, and tackle injustice. Philosopher Susan Bordo (1990) provides a pragmatic buoy by arguing that there are hierarchal and binary power structures out there that do still oppress women. The postmodern emphasis on fragmented identity, blurring of sex and gender boundaries, and gender skepticism won’t get gender theory anywhere when it comes to addressing issues such as the wage gap, eating disorders, or rape. (See Chapter&#160;18 for a fuller discussion of postmodernism.)</p>
			<p class="H1">Sociology in the Bedroom</p>
			<p class="TX1_Below_H1">Sex. You think it’s the most personal, intimate act. The bedroom is surely the one place where the sociological imagination is the last thing you’ll need. But a sociological approach can reveal some startling insights about the social construction of sexuality. Connections may be found between the sheets and history, desire and science, how we do it and how it in turn organizes what we do, as well as with whom and with what meanings. As expected, an excavation into the social construction of sexuality divulges a surprising amount of variation in what is considered normal bedroom behavior. By exposing different social patterns of sexuality, throughout history and across cultures, the sociologist can trace unequal power relations and show how sexuality expresses, represses, and elucidates those relations.</p>
			<p class="H2">Sexuality in Other Times and Places</p>
			<p class="TX1">Among the ancient Greeks, for example, homosexual relationships were accepted and supposed to be patterned on an &#173;active–&#173;passive distinction (although historians have shown that many exceptions existed). The active partner was supposed to be older or higher in status than the passive partner. To flip the rules was a violation, and it was considered shameful for a master or noble to be penetrated by a younger man. A more extreme and brutal example of sexual relations founded on power relations can be found today in the social orders in&#160;U.S.&#160;prisons, where rape is about power: Who is in charge, who is being penetrated, and who is normal versus deviant. Prison rape may not be primarily about seeking sexual gratification; it is reported that few prison rapists climax during the act. In prison, the homosexual act is often seen as something altogether distinct from homosexual identity.</p>
			<p class="TX">Or, consider sexual normality among the Sambia, a mountain people in Papua New Guinea. Anthropologist Gilbert Herdt (1981) reported that fellatio played a significant role in a boy’s transition into manhood. Young boys are initiated into manhood by a daily ritual of fellatio on older boys and men. By taking in the vital life liquid (semen) of older men, boys prepare themselves to be warriors and sexual partners with women. Fellatio, for Sambia boys, then, is the only way to become “real” men.</p>
			<p class="TX">Other cultures’ attitudes toward homosexuality are on a whole different level. Both the Siwans of North Africa and the Keraki, also in New Guinea, prefer homosexuality to heterosexuality, for fairly straightforward, practical reasons (Kimmel, 2000). Because every male is homosexual during his adolescence and then bisexual after heterosexual marriage, the limited straight sex keeps down the birthrate. In these cultures with scant resources, homosexuality makes practical sense to limit the chances of teen pregnancy and overpopulation.</p>
			<p class="TX">There is enormous variation in how humans have sex and what it means to them. &#173;Mouth-&#173;to-&#173;mouth kissing, common in Western cultures, is unthinkable among the Thonga and Sirono cultures: “But that’s where you put food!” (Kimmel, 2000). American &#173;middle-&#173;class couples have sex a few nights a week for about 15 minutes a pop; the people of Yapese cultures near Guam engage in sex once a month. Marquesan men of French Polynesia are said to have anywhere from 10 to 30 orgasms a night! Which of these is “normal”?</p>
			<p class="H2">The Social Construction of Sexuality</p>
			<p class="TX1">By treating sexuality as a social &#173;construction—&#173;that is, as always shaped by social &#173;factors—&#173;the sociologist would argue that the notion of normal, especially pertaining to what happens behind closed bedroom doors, is always contested. In other words, there is no natural way of doing it. If an essentially right way existed, we wouldn’t be able to find such wild and woolly variation throughout history and across cultures. Starting from the view that sex itself is a social creation, sociologists tend to argue that humans have sexual plumbing and potential but no sexuality until they are located in a social environment. The range of normal and abnormal is itself a construction, a production of society. The study of this range can lead the willing sociologist into an exploration of the social relations on which sex is built.</p>
			<p class="TX2"><span class="H3">Sexuality and Power</span> Marxist feminists, for instance, argue that sexuality in America is an expression of the unequal power balance between men and women. Catharine MacKinnon (1983) argued that in &#173;male-&#173;dominated societies, sexuality is constructed as a gender binary, with men on top and women on the bottom (literally and figuratively). To MacKinnon, sexuality is the linchpin of gender inequality, an expression of male control. In a &#173;male-&#173;dominated state, where men have the power to create the world from their allegedly more objective point of view, says MacKinnon, sex is rape and rape is sex: “Man fucks woman; subject verb object.”</p>
			<p class="TX">Adrienne Rich (1980) called sexuality in America a “compulsory heterosexuality.” This “political institution,” at least for some, is not a preference but something that has been imposed, managed, organized, and enforced to serve a &#173;male-&#173;dominated capitalist system in which women’s unpaid domestic work is required to support men’s paid work outside of the home. Because her work is unpaid, the woman in this situation is unable to leave a bad husband. According to Rich, people come to see heterosexuality as the norm, when it is, in fact, a mechanism integral to sustaining women’s social subordination. Although these arguments are provocative, in the end, they also reflect essentialist and reductionist views of sex. Surely not all women are mere objects or are duped into exploitative relations with their oppressive male partners.</p>
			<p class="TX2"><span class="H3">Homosexuality</span> The connections between sex and power are best exemplified in the social construction of the <span class="TXTKT">homosexual</span>, the social identity of a person who has sexual attraction to and/or relations with other persons of the same sex. For most of the past century, the dominant view has been that individuals are born either homosexual or heterosexual, gay or straight, queer or normal. Sexual orientation was thought of as a kind of personhood automatically acquired at birth or something carried in our genes (despite documented cases of identical twins in which one is straight and the other gay). But recall the ancient Greeks’ homosexual love, prison rape, and the Sambian rites of manhood. Men in these cultures engage in homosexual acts without adopting a homosexual identity. When do acts, behaviors, or desires crystallize into identities?</p>
			<p class="TX">Before 1850, there was no such thing as a homosexual. Sure, people engaged in homosexual behaviors. But around 1850, the homosexual identity was born. The French philosopher Michel Foucault (&#173;1926–&#173;1984) led the way to poststructuralist notions of the body and sexuality as historical productions. In <span class="italic">The History of Sexuality</span> (1978), Foucault made the case that the body is “in the grip” of cultural practices. That is, there is no presocial or natural body; instead, culture is always already inscribed on our bodies. It’s a by now familiar stance on the social construction of the body and on the permanent intermingling of the biological and the social. But Foucault further argued that the way in which we know our bodies is linked to power, and knowledge and power go hand in hand. As the population expanded in &#173;nineteenth-&#173;century Europe, newly formed states and their administrators developed a concern for &#173;population management. The rise of scientific ways of thinking at the time led to the creation of what Foucault calls “&#173;bio-&#173;power,” the observation and &#173;management of populations by influencing patterns in births, deaths, and illnesses.</p>
			<p class="TX">Discourses of sexuality had by then surfaced. People talked about sex, scientists studied it, and government officials tried to regulate it, whereas a century before, all this sex talk did not exist. With the development of the biological and human sciences in the nineteenth century, doctors wanted to know which kinds of sex were normal and which were deviant, and new attention was paid to policing those differences. By the late 1800s, “Homosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul” (Foucault, 1978). In Foucault’s account, homosexuality comes back to the efforts of government bureaucrats trying to assert their power (that of the state) over human populations.</p>
			<p class="TX">This new homosexual body that had been constructed became a personality type, and a deviant one at that. The American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association listed homosexuality on their list of mental disorders until 1973. Homosexuals were regarded as needing to be regulated, observed, studied, and most important, controlled. Because everyone was capable of, or in danger of, sexual deviance, the urgency to confess one’s sexuality grew, as did the scientific need for public surveillance. Who was gay? How could a homosexual be detected? Anyone could be a &#173;pervert—&#173;your professor, your roommate, even you!</p>
			<p class="TX">To regulate potentially perverse bodies, new modes of social control emerged in the transition to modern structures of state power. Coercion and direct force were replaced with more efficient forms of restraint: &#173;self-&#173;surveillance and what Foucault called <span class="italic">normalization.</span> Under a sovereign king (that is, before the modern state), discipline was administered on a scaffold or stockade, by direct punitive physical force. In modern society, discipline was administered by the self: “There is no need for arms, physical violence, material constraints. Just a gaze. An inspecting gaze, a gaze which each individual under its weight will end by interiorizing to the point that he is his own overseer, each individual thus exercising this surveillance over, and against, himself.” It was, Foucault adds, “a superb formula” (Foucault, 1980).</p>
			<p class="TX">The act of sodomy became synonymous with the person who performs it. Even our language reflects the way sexual behavior becomes more than a single event among the many other behaviors that make up an individual’s life. Here’s what I mean. If a man roasts a whole &#173;pig—&#173;a serious, &#173;time-&#173;consuming &#173;undertaking that requires research, dedication, and &#173;planning—&#173;he is not known ever after as a “pig roaster” or even as a gourmand. He’s still just Bob from down the block who hosted one heck of a barbeque. But if a man has anal sex&#160;with another &#173;man—&#173;something that takes less time and probably less dedication and research than roasting a &#173;pig—&#173;he becomes a sodomite, a homosexual, gay, or whatever terminology might fit the context. This was not always so. At one point, what happened in the bedroom stayed there. But over the last &#173;century what happened behind closed doors was outed and a whole new&#160;body and being were produced. Today our society places a huge &#173;emphasis—&#173;our entire selfhood, according to &#173;Foucault—&#173;on sexuality. Now what you do (and with whom) defines who you are: Not just how others see you, but how you experience yourself. The framing of homosexuality as a comprehensive social&#160;&#173;identity, in fact, produced homosexuals, so that today 3.4&#160;&#173;percent of&#160;Americans identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans (Gates &amp; Newport, 2012). There are hundreds of gay pride parades every year all over&#160;the country, and gay &#173;marriage is now legal in all states.</p>
			<p class="TX">Consider a widely used argument against lesbian and gay couplings: “It’s unnatural,” meaning that sex is supposed to be about reproduction. This is a popular argument against &#173;same-&#173;sex marriages, but it also stigmatizes straight couples experiencing or choosing infertility. Besides, homosexuality occurs widely in nature; one of our closest primate cousins, the bonobo, practices homosexuality (Parker, 2007). Though based on questionable data, Alfred Kinsey’s 1948 study <span class="italic">Sexual Behavior in the Human </span><span class="italic">Male</span> suggested that at least 10&#160;percent of men were homosexual. He challenged the psychiatric model of&#160;homosexuals as perverse and abnormal and instead viewed sexuality as a continuum (Kinsey, 1948). Most people, he claimed, experience both heterosexual and homosexual feelings and behaviors. Kinsey’s figures have since been &#173;disputed—&#173;his sampling was not &#173;representative of the&#160;U.S.&#160;population as a &#173;whole—&#173;but the basic idea holds. Across the globe and throughout history, there has been more or less&#160;the same degree of homosexual behavior. Social &#173;perceptions of homosexuals, however, are in&#160;flux.</p>
			<p class="TX">Studies of homosexuality today approach the phenomenon not as being located in a unified, stable, or even identifiable type of person, “the homosexual.” Rather, this fluid identity intersects with other social positions, such as class, race, age, location, ability, and gender. But how does gender influence sexuality? We’ve seen already how sex and gender do not match up; female plumbing does not always neatly correspond to a feminine gendered identity. Yale historian George Chauncey makes the case in <span class="italic">Gay New&#160;York</span> (1994) that in &#173;early-&#173;twentieth-&#173;century New&#160;York, an emerging &#173;working-&#173;class gay world was split between masculine men and the effeminate men who solicited them. As long as men stuck to their masculine gender scripts, no matter how often they engaged in gay sex, they were not considered abnormal like the girly men, who were derided for their effeminacy.</p>
			<p class="TX">The reverse is true among the <span class="italic">travesti,</span> transgender prostitutes in Brazil. Anthropologist Don Kulick conducted an ethnography of the <span class="italic">travesti</span>, males who adopt female names, clothing styles, hairstyles, cosmetic practices, and &#173;linguistic pronouns; ingest female hormones; and inject industrial silicone directly into their bodies to give themselves breasts and round buttocks or <span class="italic">bunda</span> (Kulick, 1998). They display all the stereotypically feminine traits, yet&#160;they do not &#173;self-&#173;identify as women. In fact, they think it is both repugnant and impossible for men to try to become women. Kulick argues that in Brazil, gender is determined by sexual practice; “what one does in bed has immediate and &#173;lasting consequences for the way one is perceived (and the way one can &#173;perceive &#173;oneself    ) as a gendered being. If one penetrates, in this particular configuration of sexuality and gender, one is a ‘man.’ If one expresses interest in the penis of a male, and especially if one ‘gives’—allows oneself to be penetrated by a &#173;male—&#173;then one is no longer a man.” However, the <span class="italic">travesti</span> do not think they are women; they think of themselves as <span class="italic">travesti,</span> men who emulate women but are not women. The primacy of penetration as a determinant of&#160;gender is &#173;common across cultures and challenges Americans&#160;to&#160;look&#160;beyond chromosomes and hormones to practices and cultural context.</p>
			<p class="H2">Why Not Talk about Teen Sex?</p>
			<p class="TX1">The many ways of doing &#173;it—&#173;over time and across &#173;cultures—&#173;complicate the romantic ideal of love in modern America. Arguably, a glaring discrepancy exists between this ideal and reality. In 1948, Kinsey found high rates of bisexual &#173;activity—&#173;as many as 46&#160;percent of males and between 6 and 14&#160;percent of females engaged in it. He also documented a wide variety of sexual positions, preferences, desires, and extramarital activity among men and women. The Reverend Billy Graham denied the findings and claimed that Kinsey “certainly could not have interviewed any of the millions of &#173;born-&#173;again Christian women in this country who put the highest price on virtue, decency and modesty.” Indeed, Kinsey’s sample was biased by the willingness of those who participated. Although this bias calls the exact figure into question, his study was a landmark for bringing to light a wide range of sexual practices and preferences in the&#160;U.S.&#160;population.</p>
			<p class="TX">Federal funding for studies of sexual activity has since come under attack in the name of decency. Witness the defunding of the American Teenage Study in 1992, which some politicians called one of those “reprehensive sex surveys undertaken to legitimize homosexuality and other sexually promiscuous lifestyles” (Remez, 2000).</p>
			<p class="TX2"><span class="H3">From Hooking up to Virginity Pledges</span> Sometimes the policies meant to achieve one end backfire and cause the opposite outcome, despite the best intentions. Government efforts to influence healthy teen sexuality provide one example. Recent studies have described the blasé attitude that contemporary American teenagers supposedly bring to their love lives. When sociologist Paula England surveyed students at one Midwestern university about their sex lives, half reported that their previous sexual partner was someone they had slept with only once. Here’s how she explained &#173;hook-&#173;up culture, which has replaced dating as the route to romance on college campuses around the country. She did her first surveys at Northwestern, where “before people ever go on a date, they hook up.” Lest there be any confusion: a &#173;hook-&#173;up is not sex . . . unless it is. A &#173;hook-&#173;up means “something sexual happens, that ‘something sexual’ is not always intercourse, often in fact [in] the majority of cases it isn’t, and there is no necessary implication that anybody’s interested in a relationship, but they <span class="italic">might</span> be interested.” Dating is infrequent, but it is not dead. It is “charged with more meaning now, and it’s more likely to be leading to a relationship.” Furthermore, “there’s a strong norm that relationships should be monogamous and marriages should be monogamous and that people eventually want to get to monogamy and a marriage. They’re just putting it off a lot longer. That’s really what’s changed, I think” (Conley, 2009d).</p>
			<p class="TX">Why so many &#173;short-&#173;lived &#173;hook-&#173;ups instead of &#173;longer-&#173;term relationships? For one thing, the students are not looking to begin families anytime soon. For another, relationships are just more work. England found that heterosexual males are not necessarily expected to sexually satisfy the women they hook up with, but the opposite is true when they are in relationships. In a &#173;hook-&#173;up, “a real gender inequality is if there’s oral sex but they didn’t have intercourse; sometimes it’s reciprocal, but if it is not reciprocal it’s much more likely that the woman is servicing the guy than vice versa. So it seems like the &#173;hook-&#173;ups are prioritizing male pleasure” (Conley, 2009d). In a &#173;hook-&#173;up culture, what might determine whether a pair continues to hook up or moves on to new partners? England has a theory that goes like this:</p>
			<p class="EXT1">&#173;Partner-&#173;specific investment may well be important. In other words, . . . our ability to please partners may not just be generally what have we learned from a lifetime of experience but what have we actually learned about this particular partner and what works for them and what they like and what they need. . . . If it’s &#173;hook-&#173;up number two, she’s more likely to have an orgasm than if it’s one, and if it’s three more likely, and if it’s four even more likely. (Conley, 2009d)</p>
			<p class="TX1">She also noted that these &#173;hook-&#173;ups rarely produce &#173;babies—&#173;but nearly 14&#160;percent of students still did not use any method to prevent pregnancy the last time they had sex (Centers for Disease Control and prevention [cdc], 2014).</p>
			<p class="TX">Here are more numbers: Fewer than 50&#160;percent of American high school students tell surveyors that they have had sexual intercourse (&#173;Figure&#160;8.1), but this rate is not growing; it has remained more or less steady since 2003 (CDC, 2014). Boys probably lie more often about the extent of their sexual experience (citing the proverbial girlfriend in a different state), and girls possibly downplay their sexual activity. Many of those who have not had intercourse are still sexually active in other ways. Teenagers’ romantic interludes last about 15&#160;months on average, leaving them plenty of time before marriage&#160;(average age 27 for women and 29 for men) to have many partners. To top it off, most adolescents with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) don’t know that they are infected. All of these factors combine to put American teenagers at high risk for STDs, which have been increasing dramatically since the 1970s.</p>
			<p class="TX">So what’s a public health officer to do? During its years in office, the Bush administration (&#173;2001–&#173;2009) advocated a “virginity pledge” and other abstinence policies, and the abstinence advocacy group True Love Waits says that 2.5&#160;&#173;million young people have made the virginity pledge since 1993 (Herbert, 2011). As it turns out, the pledge does, on average, delay the onset of sexual activity as well as reduce a teenager’s number of sexual partners, according to the National&#160;Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Brückner &amp; Bearman, 2005). The study, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Science Foundation, followed the sexual activity of &#173;12-&#173; to &#173;18-&#173;year-&#173;olds for six years. It found that teenagers who took the virginity pledge had about the same rates of STDs as those who never made the pledge. So when sex happens (as&#160;it almost always does), it’s much more likely to come in a rush of surprisingly strong, unfettered desire. Among the pledgers, only 40&#160;percent ended up using a condom during &#173;sex—&#173;why would they have a &#173;condom if they were planning to be virgins until marriage?—&#173;compared with 60&#160;&#173;percent of teens who had not pledged.</p>

			<p class="TX1_Below_H1">In January&#160;2005, Harvard president Larry Summers was a guest speaker at a conference called “Diversifying the Science and Engineering Work Force.” He was invited to deliver a provocative address, and indeed, his speech was so provocative that it sparked a media frenzy termed “Gendergate” by journalists. Summers stated that at the highest levels of performance, men might have an innate advantage over women in scientific aptitude and that genetic &#173;differences&#160;could explain the scarcity of female “hard” scientists at elite universities (Atlas,&#160;2005). Critics referred to the speech as a blatant example in&#160;academia of&#160;&#173;<span class="TXTKT">sexism</span>, in which a person’s sex is the basis for prejudicial discrimination and&#160;where sex may matter more than a person’s performance or&#160;merits.</p>

				<div id="_idContainer029" class="MKT-OBJ">
					<p class="MKT"><span class="KT">Sexism</span> occurs when a person’s sex or gender is the basis for judgment, discrimination, and hatred against him or her.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="TX">Summers’s explanation threw his university into turmoil and eventually led to his resignation, and likely prevented him from becoming the chair of the Federal Reserve, but the general problem he described is a real one. In 2000, although 48.2&#160;percent of students who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in math from a &#173;top-&#173;50-&#173;ranked university were female, only 8.3&#160;percent of math faculty members were women (Nelson &amp; Rogers, 2004). A flip side to this controversy is that women are overtaking men in college enrollment (Figure&#160;8.2). &#173;Fifty-seven percent of college students in 2013 were women (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). However, despite their increased enrollment, women remain overrepresented in traditionally feminine fields of study: the arts and the humanities. Men also outnumber women at elite colleges, where they are groomed for &#173;high-&#173;power professions in finance, law, or politics.</p>
			<p class="TX">Within academia, men dominate traditionally masculine fields such as math and physics. Not surprisingly, positions in these “hard” sciences pay more than those in “soft” ones. The average engineering college professor begins with a starting salary of about $78,700; the average English/literature professor starts out at $52,000 (Brantley, 2012). Do men become mathematicians and women literary critics because they are hardwired to do so? Not even Larry Summers would attribute gender segmentation in education entirely to genes. He suggested that it may be one of many factors, and even that got him into trouble. In fact, what he argued was that there was greater variance (not a higher average) in math scores for boys. Because the very highest math scorers end up at the top, and because boys had a bigger spread, the very few at the top tended to be male (as well as the few at the bottom end), even if average scores were similar across gender.</p>
			<p class="TX">Whether or not Summers’s argument holds water, we do know that men and women vary in thousands of major and minor measures. It starts at birth. The average male newborn weighs 2&#160;ounces more than the average female newborn. For infant death rates, however, the disadvantage is tilted against males, who are at higher risk of death than females. Psychologist Carol Gilligan contends that by adolescence, the disadvantages are stacked against girls, who “lose their voices” as they suffer blows to their &#173;self-&#173;confidence. Eating disorders are about twice as likely to affect adolescent and teen girls compared with their male peers. More than half of teenaged girls are on diets or think they should be. What’s more, girls more frequently report low &#173;self-&#173;esteem, more girls attempt suicide, and more girls report experiencing some form of sexual harassment in school. Psychologist Mary Pipher’s <span class="italic">Reviving Ophelia</span> (1994) details the fiery demise of adolescent girls: “Something dramatic happens to girls in early adolescence. . . . They crash and burn in a social and developmental Bermuda Triangle.”</p>
			<p class="TX">Psychologist Christina Hoff Sommers challenges this “girl crisis” in <span class="italic">The War against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men</span> (2000). She finds that because they are inadvertently penalized for the shortchanging of girls, boys are the ones suffering in education and adolescent health. For example, although females in general attempt suicide twice as frequently as males, boys ages 15 to 19 succeed in killing themselves four times more often than girls. Teenage girls may sneak more cigarettes than boys, but boys are more likely to be involved in crime, alcohol, and drugs and to be suspended from school or drop out. Male teens are also 40&#160;percent more likely to be victimized by violent crime, and that’s even taking rape into account. Being an adolescent stinks, no matter what gender (or sex) you are.</p>
			<p class="TX">What accounts for the wide range of statistical differences that exist between men and women? Essentialists might refer to natural sex differences, but sociologists are apt to call these same differences “deceptive distinctions,” those that arise because of the particular roles individuals come to occupy (Epstein, 1988). Why do men think in the abstract terms of rationality and justice? Because their employment possibilities are more likely to include jobs with these demands. Why are women so good at mothering? Because their bleak employment prospects encourage them to accept domestic roles and rely on a male’s salary. Who is more relational and who is more rational? Anthropologists William and Jean O’Barr find that the true test of what type of language an individual uses during testimony in court is the witness’s occupation, not gender (O’Barr, 1995; Kimmel, 2000). Physicists tend to speak in more abstract terms, teachers in more relational ones, regardless of gender. Once such deceptive distinctions are revealed, it is easy to flip the &#173;essentialist&#160;&#173;rhetoric to see that gender differences are a product of gender inequality, not the cause. Physicists speak in more abstract terms, teachers in more relational ones because their jobs demand it. The question then shifts to, Why do men and women end up disproportionately split into occupations by gender? We need to peel back another layer of the gender onion.</p>
			<p class="H2">Gender Inequality in the Classroom</p>
			<p class="TX1">We can find one answer (or onion layer) in the educational system. As we saw in our discussion of &#173;gender-&#173;role socialization in Chapter&#160;4, the classroom functions as a sort of gender training ground for boys and girls. Not only does the classroom begin training children how to act properly gendered (which toys to play with, what colors to wear), but this is the place where children learn quickly about gender inequality. In <span class="italic">Failing at Fairness,</span> education professors Myra and David Sadker (1994) report that boys are called on more in class, they interrupt girls (and get away with it) more often than the reverse, and their teachers expect them to be better at math and worse at reading. Girls, the authors show, are frequently bullied out of classroom discussion, put down by their male classmates, and effectively silenced. Boys and girls may share one classroom, but they receive two separate educations. (See Chapter&#160;13 for more on the &#173;boy–&#173;girl achievement gap.)</p>
			<p class="TX">When students open their schoolbooks or turn on the television set, they may find further representations of gender inequalities. In 1975, when the&#160;U.S.&#160;Department of Health, Education, and Welfare surveyed children’s books, it found that active boys, shown outdoors having exciting and important adventures, populated textbooks. When shown at all, girls remained passive, dependent, and bored (and usually boring). Since then, some changes have been made. For example, representations in the popular media, once highly reflective of the same stereotypes as in textbooks, have increasingly shown more girls in active &#173;roles—&#173;engaged in sports, holding careers, and defying traditional stereotypes of homemaking femininity. Girls, so it appears in the media, are catching up. But representations of masculine roles have remained defiantly distant from child rearing, housework, and nurturance.</p>
			<p class="H2">Inequality at Work</p>
			<p class="TX1">The same trend holds fast in the real world of work and family, where women’s roles have expanded into paid work while men’s have hardly budged toward more involvement in the domestic sphere (see Chapter&#160;12). The past few decades have brought arguably the biggest change in American gender relations. Since the 1970s, almost 37&#160;million more women have entered the labor force, from 31.5&#160;million in 1970 to 72&#160;million in 2010 (Figure&#160;8.3). Of course, the overall population has increased by 50&#160;percent in that period as well, accounting for part of the rise, but the percentage of women ages 16 to 64 who are in the workforce has risen from approximately 43&#160;to 57&#160;percent in 2013. In fact, because the Great Recession of &#173;2008–&#173;2009 hit &#173;male-&#173;dominated industries the hardest (such as construction), it helped accelerate the trend toward gender equality in labor force participation<span lang="en-GB">; in fact, there was a breif period at the depth of the economic crisis during which women’s totals exceeded those of men in the workforce. However, men have since caught up and reclaimed their majority position: men’s labor force participation is at 69 percent compared to women’s 57 percent. Because women are disproportionately employed in the public sector, and state governments have yet to recover from the twin challenges of economic woes and ballooning budgets, it may be some time before women once again approach parity (Covert, 2011).</span></p>
			<p class="TX">The greater number of women entering the labor force has not catapulted them to equality with their male peers in the workplace (see Chapter&#160;14). Despite the passage of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which declared it unlawful for employers to discriminate on the basis of a person’s race, nationality, creed, or sex, women have continued to fare much worse than their male counterparts in the workforce. Although legally entitled to enter all lines of work, women routinely face <span class="TXTKT">sexual harassment</span>, an illegal form of discrimination that runs the gamut from inappropriate jokes on the job to outright sexual assault to sexual “barter,” in which women workers give sexual favors under the threat of punishment (Kimmel, 2000). Intended to make women feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, sexual harassment occurs across many settings and in all kinds of &#173;relationships—&#173;walking down the street and having to listen to “Whooo, baby!” is just one annoying everyday example. In the workplace, some argue, sexual harassment is one of the chief ways in which men resist gender equality. In 1982, the&#160;U.S.&#160;Court of Appeals ruled that sexual harassment is a violation of the Civil Rights Act, because it is a form of discrimination against an individual on the basis of sex. But even though sexual harassment is illegal, it often takes insidious forms not easily detected by everyone or verifiable in court. Most commonly, sexual harassment takes the form of “hostile environments” in which women feel unsafe, excluded, singled out, and mocked.</p>

					<p class="MKT"><span class="KT">Sexual harassment</span> an illegal form of discrimination, involving everything from inappropriate jokes on the job to outright sexual assault to sexual “barter”—all intended to make women feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, particularly on the job.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="TX">In addition to working in such hostile environments, women have consistently been paid less than their male peers, earning about 81 cents to every $1 of a man’s wage (BLS, 2013a; Figure&#160;8.4). (In some large, economically successful cities, however, the gender gap may be shrinking or even reversing among young adults.) The media touted women’s gains in the 1970s and 1980s, when masses of women entered the&#160;U.S.&#160;labor force. Yet women disproportionately entered the lower rungs of the occupational hierarchy. These feminized jobs, what Louise Howe (1977) calls “&#173;pink-&#173;collar” jobs, are &#173;low-&#173;paid secretarial or service industry jobs. Cleaning buildings, filing papers, and making coffee are hardly what women imagine when they dream of independence.</p>
			<p class="TX">Many new women workers find themselves shuffled into occupations dominated by other women, and women who go into a &#173;male-&#173;dominated field often find that, soon enough, they are surrounded by women. Like names, jobs become feminized when too many women hit the scene. This has happened in fields such as real estate sales, clerical work, pharmacy, public relations, bartending, bank telling, and more recently, sociology. In <span class="italic">Job Queues, Gender Queues</span> (1990), sociologists Barbara Reskin and Patricia Roos argue that women end up in &#173;lower-&#173;paid jobs because these occupations lose (or have lost) their attractiveness for white men. When a job becomes deskilled and less autonomous, earnings decline, and work conditions in general deteriorate, men flee to better positions, leaving (typically white) women next in line to shuffle into the ranks of men’s &#173;cast-&#173;off work.</p>
			<p class="TX">Take book editing, which changed from a “gentlemen’s profession” to a virtual female ghetto in the &#173;mid-&#173;twentieth century. Formerly the &#173;high-&#173;cultural mission of men with elite academic records, book editing evolved into a more commercial enterprise in the 1960s and 1970s. The result was that editorial work took a downturn in autonomy, job security, and importance. As the job lost its attractiveness to male candidates, the female labor supply was increasing on the crest of &#173;second-&#173;wave feminism. Thus, book-editing jobs, like the other fields that optimists point to as women’s inroads into traditionally &#173;male-&#173;dominated work, became resegregated and ghettoized as women’s work. And anything categorized as women’s work tends to yield lower pay, prestige, and benefits such as health coverage than men’s.</p>
			<p class="TX2"><span class="H3">Glass Ceilings</span> When women do enter more prestigious corporate worlds, they often encounter gendered barriers to reaching the very top: the &#173;so-&#173;called <span class="TXTKT">glass ceiling</span>, which effectively is an invisible limit on women’s climb up the occupational ladder. Sociologist Rosabeth Moss Kanter argues in her classic study <span class="italic">Men and Women of the Corporation</span> (1977) that the dearth of women in top corporate positions results from a cultural conflation of authority with masculinity. In Indesco, the fictitious name of the corporation Kanter studied, she found another case of deceptive distinctions at work: Most people believe that men and women come to occupy the kinds of jobs for which they are naturally best suited. Secretaries are predominantly women (98.6&#160;percent), according to this belief, because women seem to act the feminine part better than they play the masculine managerial role.</p>
			<div class="_idGenObjectLayout-2">
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="MKT-OBJ">
					<p class="MKT"><span class="KT">Glass ceiling</span> an invisible limit on women’s climb up the occupational ladder.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="TX">To the contrary, Kanter showed, job segregation often works the other way around: The job makes the person; the person doesn’t make the job. Employee behavior tends to be determined by job requirements and the constraints of the organizational structure of the company. At Indesco, secretarial positions derived status from that of the boss. The job was also based on principled arbitrariness, meaning that there were no limits to the boss’s discretion as to what his secretary should do (type, fax, pick up his dry cleaning, look after his dog when he’s away). Furthermore, secretarial work was characterized by fealty, the demand of personal loyalty and devotion of secretary to boss. Under these conditions, secretaries adopted certain behaviors to get through a day’s work, including timidity and &#173;self-&#173;effacement, addiction to praise, and displays of &#173;emotion—&#173;all qualities that Indesco bosses tended to think of as just the way women are.</p>
			<p class="TX">What happens when a woman breaks into a top managerial position? She becomes a numerical minority, what Kanter calls a token, a &#173;stand-&#173;in for all women. Because tokens have heightened visibility, they experience greater performance pressures. Male peers tend to rely on gender stereotypes when interpreting a token’s behavior, seeing female managers as “seductresses, mothers, pets,” or tough “iron maidens.” When a token female manager botches the job, it just goes to show that women can’t handle the corporate world and should be kept out of it.</p>
			<p class="TX">Similarly, Jennifer&#160;L.&#160;Pierce’s study of law firms (1995) showed that sexual stereotypes, as much as organizational structure, are underlying causes of job segregation. Paralegals make up a feminized “&#173;semi-&#173;profession”: About 86&#160;percent of them are women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, women account for only 16&#160;percent of law firm partners, even though, for the last two decades, the number of women graduating from law school was about 39 to 49&#160;percent of all graduates (Scharf &amp; Flom, 2010).</p>
			<p class="TX">Paralegals are expected to be deferential (that is, they should not stick up for themselves), caring, and even motherly toward the trial lawyers for whom they work. Given the adversarial model of the&#160;U.S.&#160;legal system, trial lawyers, in contrast, perform what Pierce (1995) calls masculine emotional labor. To excel in the job takes aggression, intimidation, and manipulation. When a woman joins the higher ranks of trial lawyering, she’s likely to face exclusion from informal socializing with her colleagues (no drinks after work), deflation of her job status (frequently being mistaken for a secretary), sexual harassment, and difficulty bringing clients into the firm. Female litigators find themselves in a double bind not experienced by their male counterparts. When deploying courtroom tactics of aggression and &#173;intimidation—&#173;the very qualities that make a male lawyer successful and &#173;respected—&#173;women litigators find themselves being called “bitches,” “obnoxious,” and “shrill.” But when they fail to act like proper “Rambo litigators” in the courtroom, women are equally chided for being “too nice” and “too bashful.” The &#173;trade-&#173;off between being a good woman and being a successful lawyer adds yet another obstacle for women to make it to the top in &#173;male-&#173;dominated jobs.</p>
			<p class="TX2"><span class="H3">Glass Escalators</span> Just as the odds are stacked against female tokens, they tilt in favor of men in &#173;female-&#173;dominated jobs. In <span class="italic">Still a Man’s World</span> (1995), Christine Williams found that male nurses, elementary school teachers, librarians, and social workers inadvertently maintain masculine power and privilege. Specifically, when token men enter feminized jobs, they enjoy a quicker rise to leadership positions on the aptly named <span class="TXTKT">glass escalator</span>. These escalators also operate in law firms, where male paralegals, themselves tokens in the overwhelmingly female &#173;semi-&#173;profession, reap benefits from their heightened visibility (Pierce, 1995). Male paralegals are said to enjoy preferential treatment over their female peers, such as promotions and even the simple (but substantial) benefit of being invited to happy hour with the litigators.</p>

				<div id="_idContainer032" class="MKT-OBJ">
					<p class="MKT"><span class="KT">Glass escalator</span> the accelerated promotion of men to the top of a work organization, especially in feminized jobs.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="TX">Or at least that is how it used to be. Williams’s new research suggests that women are holding a more equitable share of the top spots in nursing, elementary schools, and libraries, but that a larger problem is emerging that hits both men and women: wages in these careers have not kept pace with the cost of living (Williams, 2013). Careers that have traditionally been associated with women are not the only ones that have seen declining wages. Manufacturing, trucking, and warehouse &#173;jobs—&#173;traditionally dominated by male &#173;workers—&#173;are also paying less (Mishel &amp; Shierholz, 2013).</p>
			<p class="TX">In the fashion industry, the escalator reverses the gender filter Williams originally found for &#173;women-&#173;dominated fields. Aspiring male models are forced off at the second floor while a small number of women models can continue to top model status. I talked to former model Ashley Mears about the wage structure in the modeling industry. She confirmed that “you see a complete inverse” where “women outearn men by two to one, sometimes much more” and that “there are just more jobs and opportunities for women models.” She explained that there are two reasons for this, one cultural and one structural. From a cultural perspective, “for a man to do the work of showing his body, displaying his body, it’s read as being less than what we fully expect in a hegemonically masculine way. It’s read as being effeminate work.” From a structural perspective there simply are no stepping stones to managerial positions or other promotions for models. According to Mears (who became a sociologist), on the models’ job escalator, “there’s no place to go,” because career positions in the fashion industry go to experienced businesspeople and designers (Conley, 2013c).</p>
			<p class="TX1">During World War&#160;II, America got a gender makeover. When 6&#160;million American women flooded the factory labor force in response to the nation’s call for help, they were galvanized by the &#173;now-&#173;familiar Rosie the Riveter image. Hollywood discovered Rose Monroe in the 1940s, when she was working at an aircraft parts factory in Michigan; she was quickly remade into a female hero, espousing such empowering slogans as “We can do it!” (Enloe, 2000). Most women taking on men’s jobs such as skilled factory work were eager to acquire the new skills and living wages that women’s &#173;pink-&#173;collar jobs had not offered. Some of them were coaxed to the factories by offers of child care and &#173;ready-&#173;made meals they could take home to their families at the end of the work day. But as Ruth Milkman (1987) argues, the increase in female employment did not lead to gender equity. Far from it. Job segregation by sex did not break down; it just took new forms, redefining women’s wartime work as an extension of domesticity, the new but temporary “woman’s place.” The work of women in factories was revised to be “women’s work.” It was supposedly light and less strenuous, clean, and even glamorous. Furthermore, it was still segregated by sex, and women earned less than male factory workers.</p>
			<p class="TX">At the end of the war, husbands, brothers, and sons returned, and the nation called on women yet again to make a &#173;sacrifice—&#173;this time to return to the domestic life. In just four years, millions of women went from their homes to the factories and back again. Occupational segregation by sex persisted throughout, as it still does today. Did Rosie’s dramatic moment amount to nothing? Maybe not, as it turns out.</p>
			<p class="TX">A mother’s employment outside the home is known to affect kids in surprising ways. In families where the mother works, even part time, brothers and sisters are more likely to end up as economic equals down the road (Conley, 2004) and adopt more egalitarian attitudes toward gender roles (Kimmel, 2000). The kids may even spend fewer hours watching television (Bianchi &amp; Robinson, 1997). Regardless of early sex role socialization, Rosie’s factory days made a ripple in the prevailing gender norms. This ripple was surely felt by her children, who had been exposed to new definitions of what a woman could be. This is just one sociological explanation of women’s gains in equality today. Another interpretation is offered by Robert Jackson (1998), who makes the case that women are destined for equality because in a modern economy with rationalized, bureaucratic organizations, it just doesn’t make strategic sense to be prejudiced against women. There’s something irrational and inefficient, it seems, about sex discrimination. It doesn’t make economic sense.</p>
			<p class="TX">What both explanations underscore is the potential of sociology to account for changes in social structures like gender that too often we take as given and fixed. In the study of sex and gender (as in other “sociologies”), social structures and context matter. What seems to be normal or natural often turns out to be fluid and contingent. The stuff we build up around the &#173;plumbing—&#173;roles, expectations, psyches, &#173;institutions—&#173;is not essential. These are socially constructed facts, built less on the biological and more on the existing social structures of relations.</p>
			<p class="TX">We’ve traced the intricate details through which a system of sexes, genders, and sexualities has evolved. Can we “undo gender,” or are we stuck in the paradox of reproducing our own creation, even if we recognize its inequalities? If we humans have constructed gender as a way to organize, simplify, and control a messy social world, then indeed we can deconstruct it. Judith Lorber (1994) argues that only when we stop using gender as a basis for dividing up the &#173;world—&#173;in terms of which jobs people hold, what rights they exercise, how much money they earn, how much control they have over their bodies, and with whom they can have &#173;sex—&#173;will we find true equality in the world.</p>

			<p class="PBH">Welcome to Ze College, Ze</p>
			<p class="TX1"><span lang="en-GB">After the legalization of same-sex marriage by the Supreme Court and growing social acceptance of homosexuality across the nation, the next frontier in sex, sexuality, and gender with respect to human rights is dawning: the shattering of the gender dichotomy. Television and film are depicting more transgender characters (</span><span class="italic" lang="en-GB">Transparent</span><span lang="en-GB"> and </span><span class="italic" lang="en-GB">Orange is the New Black</span><span lang="en-GB"> are two shows that have done so). Colleges, too, are at the forefront of this reconfiguration of sex/gender identity to accommodate a wider range of affiliation. The speed of this reconfiguration of policy has been astounding over the last few years</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">For example, the State University of New York, one of the nation’s largest state university systems, is now allowing students to choose among seven gender identities, including “trans man,” ‘‘questioning” and “genderqueer.” Harvard University and other colleges now have spaces to allow for students to choose gender-neutral pronouns such as “they” or “ze.” Other schools are sure to follow. That’s the easy part: just like choosing how we want someone to address us—by our formal name or nickname or initials—it seems pretty straightforward to allow individuals to select their own pronouns.</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">But implementing a fluid notion of sex/gender identity for all aspects of the life in the institution we call campus gets a lot trickier. For starters, there is the question of unisex colleges. Women’s colleges, often founded to create an academic space where women could be groomed into leaders away from gender dynamics involving men, face a particular challenge. One of the most prestigious women’s colleges, Barnard in New York City, recently clarified what it means to be a woman. The trustees voted to “consider for admission those applicants who consistently live and identify as women, regardless of the gender assigned to them at birth. We will also continue to use gendered language that reflects our identity as a women’s college.” Once a person is in, the policy states, all bets are off, meaning that someone can transition to male, and he won’t be kicked out.</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">Like the expanded set of pronouns, this seems like a logical solution. Next is roommate policy. A growing number of colleges (over 200) allow gender-neutral housing options. Individuals who sign up for this option (initiated by Oberlin in 1970) are open to rooming with someone of the same or opposite sex in their suite or dorm room. In this arrangement, individuals could indicate the range of genders (cis-male, trans-female, etc.) with which they would be comfortable matching.</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">Next up is sports. The policy of Bates College—which is fairly typical of the NCAA—is the following: “A transgender student athlete should be allowed to participate in any sports activity so long as that athlete’s use of hormone therapy, if any, is consistent with the National College Athletic Association (NCAA) existing policies on banned medications.” So, a female transitioning to male via hormone therapy is no longer allowed to compete on women’s teams but is eligible for men’s sports. Ditto in reverse. The NCAA writ large does not have a mandatory policy for transgender inclusion, but the association claims that inclusion is a “NCAA value” (Kanno-Youngs, 2015).</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">The final frontier—on college campuses and beyond—has been locker room policy. Government agencies have ruled that Title VII of the Civil Right Act’s prohibitions on sex discrimination to bar employment discrimination based on gender identity and that this includes locker room segregation. The Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education rejected the argument that female students needed to be protected from being seen naked by an individual who was biologically still male. Separate facilities for transgendered individuals were seen to be akin to the now unacceptable “separate but equal” racial policy of Jim Crow. Since Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity, the issue of locker rooms would seem to be resolved (for any institution that gets Federal money, which is basically almost every college) (Phillips, Wagner, and Clifton, 2015).</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">However, as political winds shift, this is likely not the final word on the matter. “Known for its ‘judgement free zone’ slogan, Planet Fitness has stated its locker room policy allows members and guests to use the facilities that correspond with their ‘sincere self-reported gender identity’” (Shepherd, 2015). A woman who lost her Planet Fitness gym membership for railing against this policy (namely, “warning” other clients) sued the company. Her lawsuit was dismissed; however, she is appealing (Keller, 2016). Whether or not her appeal is successful, chances are the issue will eventually end up in the Supreme Court. The attorney arguing the case against Plant Fitness dismisses analogies to race and instead frames it as a privacy issue: “There are lines that society can draw, and there’s lines of common sense and common decency that, for example, biological men should not be allowed to undress and shower with women and 13-year-old girls—which would be the Planet Fitness situation—and impose their self-identification on other people</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">.</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">.</span><span lang="en-GB"> </span><span lang="en-GB">. this is so ripe for abuse, for somebody to just come in and say ‘Oh, I’m transitioning. I feel like I’m a transgender person. I’m gonna go in, use the women’s locker room.’ And then bad things happen” (Hobson, 2015).</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">While clearly there are still debates to have and issues to address such as the one raised above, what’s remarkable up until now, however, is how quickly institutions have figured out policies to accommodate a rapid rearrangement of something that was once seen as so “natural”—i.e., the dual-gender system. It is almost as if everyone is now a sociologist, and our work is done.</span></p>
			<p class="TX"><span lang="en-GB">Here’s an idea: How about we all just get our own stalls to change in along with private showers? Many shy people would appreciate that regardless of the fluidity of gender and locker rooms.</span></p>
