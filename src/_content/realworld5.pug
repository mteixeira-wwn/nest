                    p.TX-1
                        | In order for social inequality to persist, the unequal treatment that minority groups suffer must be supported by the dominant groups. #[+keyterm('racism') Racism], an ideology or set of beliefs about the claimed superiority of one racial or ethnic group over another, provides this support; it is used to justify unequal social arrangements between the dominant and minority groups. Racist beliefs are often rooted in the assumption that differences among groups are innate, or biologically based. They can also arise from a negative view of a group&rsquo;s cultural characteristics. In both cases, racism presumes that one group is better than another.
                    h2#D-head_90.D Prejudice and Discrimination
                    p.TX-1
                        | Prejudice and discrimination are closely related to racism, and though the terms are often used interchangeably, there are important distinctions between them. #[+keyterm('prejudice') Prejudice], literally a &ldquo;prejudgment,&rdquo; is an inflexible attitude (usually negative, although it can work in the reverse) about a particular group of people and is rooted in generalizations or stereotypes. Examples of prejudice include opinions like &ldquo;All Irish are drunks&rdquo; or &ldquo;All Mexicans are lazy.&rdquo; Prejudice often, though not always, leads to #[+keyterm('discrimination') discrimination]: an action or behavior that results in the unequal treatment of individuals because of their membership in a certain racial or ethnic group. A person might be said to suffer discrimination if she is turned down for a job promotion or a home loan because she&rsquo;s black or Hispanic.
                    p.TX
                        | It is possible, though unlikely, that a person can be prejudiced and still not discriminate against others. For example, a teacher can believe that Asian American students are better at math and science, yet deliberately not let this belief influence his grading of Asian American students. Conversely, a person may not be prejudiced at all but still unknowingly participate in discrimination. Members of the dominant group, still whites in America, may enjoy certain benefits and advantages denied to minority group members. Whites may believe in equality but not act in such a way as to challenge the injustices perpetuated by our systems of stratification.
                    p.TX
                        | And prejudice and discrimination don&rsquo;t always flow from the dominant group toward minorities. The 2008 film #[em Gran Torino] (#[a(href="#&gid=1&pid=1") Figure 1]) features Clint Eastwood as a crotchety old white man with prejudices against his Italian barber, Irish construction workers, black street kids, and Asian neighbors.

And even given this mutual dislike based on ethnic backgrounds, Eastwood&rsquo;s character comes to know and love his Hmong neighbors, protecting them with a tremendous act of self-sacrifice.

                        | Discrimination can also take different forms. #[+keyterm('individual-discrimination') Individual discrimination] occurs when one person treats others unfairly because of their race or ethnicity. A racist teacher might discriminate against a Hispanic student by assigning him a lower grade than he deserves. #[+keyterm('institutional-discrimination') Institutional discrimination], in contrast, is usually more systematic and widespread and occurs when institutions (such as governments, schools, or banks) practice discriminatory policies that affect whole groups of individuals.
                    p.TX
                        | A rather startling example of institutional discrimination comes from Ira Katznelson (2005) in his book

                            | When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth Century America
                        | . We usually associate affirmative action with the advances of the civil rights movement of the 1960s and with benefiting blacks and other minorities. Katznelson, however, examines one instance of special government policies benefiting whites. In 1944, Congress passed the G.I. Bill of Rights, which provided funding for college or vocational education and home loans to returning World War II veterans. While this should have supported black and white veterans alike, in practice blacks were largely impeded from taking advantage of the new benefits, while whites more easily climbed into the rapidly expanding American middle class. Typically, loans were granted only to those buying homes in all-white neighborhoods. And blacks were effectively barred from buying homes in those neighborhoods, either through legal restrictions or from hostile actions on the part of loan officers, real-estate agents, and homeowners who were prejudiced against having blacks live next door. To make matters worse, loans were even denied to blacks who wished to buy homes in black neighborhoods; these were seen as risky investments. Later affirmative action programs for other groups were actually modeled after those of the postwar era that had benefited whites and, ironically, created an even greater economic disparity between racial groups.

                        | Another example comes from Lawrence Otis Graham (1996), a Princeton- and Harvard-trained African American lawyer who investigated firsthand institutionalized racism in the upper-crust world of the East Coast elite. He found that, for example, he was not able to join a particular Connecticut country club as a member; however, he was welcome to serve in the capacity of busboy to the club&rsquo;s all-white membership and waitstaff. This shocked Graham; he believed his Ivy League credentials would open any door but discovered that in a racially stratified society, a black man with privileged socioeconomic status is still a black man in the end. Sadly, little has changed in a generation. Graham (2014) recently wrote of his teenage son&rsquo;s experience of being called the &ldquo;N-word&rdquo; from a moving car as he walked to class at a prestigious East Coast boarding school.

                        | Some students have difficulty recognizing just how persistent and pervasive racism is in contemporary American society, while others experience it on a daily basis. We hear claims that it has been erased. But although there have been tremendous strides, especially in the wake of the civil rights movement, racism is not yet a thing of the past. There is still deep skepticism among minorities that negative racial attitudes are changing in America (Bobo, Kluegel, and Smith 1997; Bobo and Smith 1998). A survey conducted by NBC News in 2014 found that only 20 percent of Americans believed race relations had gotten better since the 2008 election of President Barack Obama, while 38 percent said they had gotten worse (NBC 2014). A 2013 Gallup poll revealed that 39 percent of whites and 49 percent of blacks believed that race relations will always be a problem in the United States (Gallup 2015).
                    h2#D-head_91.D White Privilege and Color-Blind Racism
                    p.TX-1
                        | The concept of #[+keyterm('privilege') privilege] is gaining greater currency while still garnering much debate. There are various mechanisms of privilege. In a stratified society one may have privilege based on class, race, gender, sexuality, or other factors. The idea of the privileges of race dates back to early sociology and the work of W. E. B. Du Bois (1903). More recently, Peggy McIntosh (1988) reintroduced the idea in a well-known article about &ldquo;unpacking the invisible knapsack&rdquo; of white privilege. In the past few decades, the idea has made its way into the various branches of academia and more widely into the national conversation. &ldquo;White privilege&rdquo; is the idea that one group (whites) in a society enjoys certain unearned advantages not available to others (nonwhites) and that group members (whites) are largely unaware of the unequal benefits they possess. Privilege can include a wide range of advantages that are experienced within our large social institutions as well as in our small everyday interactions.
                    p.TX
                        | Because privilege is often invisible to the privileged, it can blind them to the challenges faced by members of nonprivileged groups. Whites may claim, for example, that race no longer matters, and that we live in a &ldquo;color-blind&rdquo; society. After all, we elected a black president, so racism must be a thing of the past, right? The notion of colorblindness sounds good (judging people by the &ldquo;content of their character&rdquo; rather than by the color of their skin), but it is also problematic because it implies that race should be both invisible and inconsequential. And that just isn&rsquo;t true.
                    p.TX
                        | Race does matter, and racism does still exist. Racism today is neither as blatant as it once was&#8212;blacks and whites don&rsquo;t use separate bathrooms or drinking fountains&#8212;nor is it only a black-and-white issue. But it has taken other, more subtle forms, such as the high concentration of liquor stores in predominantly black urban areas or the high concentration of Latino immigrants in low-wage jobs. Claims of colorblindness make these more subtle forms of racism difficult to acknowledge and, therefore, difficult to address productively. According to social scientists like Eduardo Bonilla-Silva (2009; 2013), colorblindness is just a new form of racism.
                    p.TX #[+keyterm('color-blind-racism') Color-blind racism] is hard to combat. But there is an alternative: #[+keyterm('race-consciousness') race consciousness], or an awareness of the importance of race in our everyday lives and in our dealings with social institutions. A race-conscious approach recognizes that despite the civil rights gains of the last hundred years, race is still a powerful factor in shaping our everyday lives. If we are to have a truly egalitarian society, we must recognize the historical record of racism and the social conditions that perpetuate contemporary inequalities
                    h2#D-head_92.D Cultural Appropriation
                    p.TX-1
                        | Another, not always subtle, form of racism has been identified as the practice of #[+keyterm('cultural-appropriation') cultural appropriation]. Cultural appropriation is when members of the dominant group adopt, co-opt, or otherwise take cultural elements from a marginalized group and use them for their own advantage. Cultural elements can include art, music, dance, dress, language, religious rituals, and other forms of expression that originate in a particular group. We see this borrowing (or some would say stealing) of cultural elements in a range of contexts, from costumes for Halloween or for college theme parties, to the carefully crafted images and musical stylings of singers like Katy Perry and Iggy Azalea.

                        | Let&rsquo;s look at some of the many instances of using the cultural symbols of various Native American peoples. Recent fashion runway trends have included suede and fringe, moccasins and turquoise jewelry. Add to that some championship sports teams like the MLB&rsquo;s Cleveland Indians or the NFL&rsquo;s Washington Redskins, both of which continue to use their derogatory names (and mascots) despite widespread objections. Critics contend that it is a problem when specific items or practices with sacred value (such as a headdress or a sweat lodge) are used without awareness of their significance or in a disrespectful way. Furthermore, cultural appropriation most often benefits the dominant group, which takes an oppressed group&rsquo;s cultural symbols and turn them into a commodity for profit. This kind of pillaging is postmodern cultural imperialism.

                        | Sometimes cultural appropriation is just insensitive. It can hurt the members of an aggrieved group, who may feel wronged, insulted, and offended. At the same time, it can have broader effects and serve to perpetuate negative stereotypes, exacerbate interracial relations, and further entrench social inequalities.
                    p.TX
                        | It is not always clear when the use of cultural elements by an outsider constitutes cultural appropriation and when it is cultural appreciation, and this ambiguity has been a source of debate. A case in point is the story of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who identified as black and went to great lengths to embody that chosen identity. A civil rights activist, leader of a local chapter of the NAACP, and professor of Africana studies, Dolezal presented herself as black for many years until her parents revealed in 2015 that their daughter was white like them. Suddenly, Dolezal was the center of controversy and the subject of much impassioned dialogue about race and racial identity. Some characterized what Dolezal did as &ldquo;passing,&rdquo; although in the opposite way it usually works. Others sympathized with her deep identification and desire to immerse herself in black culture (Michael 2015). Others questioned why she hadn&rsquo;t just been honest about her racial background, remaining an ally to the black community and to the cause of justice. Still many more felt deeply incensed by Dolezal&rsquo;s deception and by her claims to have experienced, as a black woman, racial oppression. She was widely rebuked and accused of cultural appropriation&#8212;and worse.

                        | With increasing awareness of the issues of cultural appropriation, some of the most blatant incidents are being addressed. But it is not altogether easy to avoid some use of cultural elements that belong to other groups, and sometimes that usage is meant as an homage. What can you do? First, become aware. Educate yourself about the cultural traditions of a group you admire or emulate so you will have some idea about how to approach that group with sensitivity and respect. Let them define what is appropriate and inappropriate for outsiders. Give proper credit for attribution if you use elements of their culture. Lastly, work toward authentic cultural exchange, which must be based on greater social equality.
